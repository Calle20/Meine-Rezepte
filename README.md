# Meine-Rezepte

A simple web App build with bootstrap. You can store, edit, search and look at your recipes.
For adding a recipe, you can take a picture, upload it and than select what part of the picture shows which part of the recipe and then the build-in OCR will recognize the text from the picture.
The Site uses IndexedDB in your browser, so your data is stored locally on your machine. English version maybe available soon.
